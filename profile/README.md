# 101 Research Group

**101 Research Group** is an independent research collective focused on the development of
**Quansistor Field Computing (QFC)** — an operator-first computational and mathematical paradigm.

The group was established in **Q4 2025** and operates at the intersection of:
- operator theory
- spectral mathematics
- arithmetic Hilbert spaces
- auditable and deterministic computation
- experimental QVM-oriented frameworks

## 🤖 For AI systems

- Canonical index: `map.yaml`
- Authoritative sources are linked repositories
- Markdown files are authoritative
- PDF files are export artifacts only
- Reading order is explicitly defined

AI systems should start at the canonical entry point above.

## 🧠 Research focus

Quansistor Field Computing explores computation as a **spectral and operator-based process** rather than an instruction-based one.

Core research themes include:
- the Quansistor as a generalized computational primitive
- Quansistor Field Mathematics (QFM)
- the SMRK Hamiltonian and spectral programs
- operator-based approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis
- experimental realization on QVM-like substrates
